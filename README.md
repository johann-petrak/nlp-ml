# nlp-ml - Library and Tools for doing Machine Learning for NLP, mainly PyTorch-Based

UPDATE: maybe this is now unnecessary if we use e.g. PyText,
so this is really just a very thin wrapper around the most important libs!!

This is just a collection of things I use for ML, mainly PyTorch-based DL for NLP tasks.

Main purpose: **Make it simple!**

Main aims:
* combine with and use useful other libraries, where possible, but only when necessary
* have some standard solutions for standard tasks
* everything must scale to very big datasets, definitely OOC (out of core) data


Main features so far:
* A PyTorch module base class that can be used more Keras-like, but also allows complex
  models. Supports callbacks, metrics etc.
* Dataset implementations for fast use of large line-based corpora in TSV or simple CSV format,
  and for corpora in one file per document formats
* Transforms for processing instances 
* Dataset implementation that can run transforms on the fly and cache results in various ways
* Support for my own conventions of how to represent instances
* Support for files generated by the GATE LearningFramework plugin
* A collection of SoA models, wrapped in a consistent fashion. If the license allows it, 
  a working version is included. The following models are currently included:
  * NCRFpp 
  * BERT
  * ELMO
  * DAN

## Libraries used 


For now, we want to consider:
* fastai
* torch text
* skorch
* dstoolbox
* PyText !!
  * https://facebook.ai/developers/tools/pytext
  * https://pytext-pytext.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/

## Installation and Requirements

Requirements:
* Python 3.5 or newer, Python 2.x is NOT supported (why would you want to use that anyways?)
* Pytorch 4.0 or newer

Installation:
```
pip install -U nlpml
```
